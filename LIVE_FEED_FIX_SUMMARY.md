# Live Feed Buffering Fix - Implementation Summary

## Issue Description
The TUI live feed was appearing to "stall" during long-running operations in the Python automation pipeline, despite work continuing in the background.

## Root Cause Analysis
The investigation revealed that Python's stdout buffering behavior changes when output is piped:
- **Terminal output**: Line-buffered (immediate)
- **Piped output** (as with Go runner): Block-buffered (4KB-8KB blocks)
- Progress messages would accumulate in the buffer until it filled, causing apparent "stalls"

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Print Logger Enhancement (Already Present)
The `logging_utils.py` module already had the core fix implemented:
```python
def tee_print(*args, **kwargs):
    # ... logging logic ...
    kwargs.setdefault("flush", True)  # Force immediate output
    ORIGINAL_PRINT(*args, **kwargs)
```

### 2. Explicit Flushing Added to Critical Operations
Added `flush=True` to critical print statements during long-running operations:

#### In `app.py`:
- Git fetch operations: `"Synchronizing base branch from origin…"`
- Git checkout operations: `"Creating/checking out working branch…"`
- Git commit operations: `"Committed changes with message: {commit_message}"`
- Git push operations: `"Pushed branch '{new_branch}' to origin."`
- Final status: `"Final TASKS_LEFT={tasks_left}"`

#### In `review_loop.py`:
- Review waiting period: `"Waiting {initial_wait_minutes} minutes for bot reviews…"`
- Feedback detection: `"Unresolved feedback detected, asking the bot to fix…"`

#### In `local_loop.py` (already present):
- Implementation launches: `"→ Launching implementation pass with {runner_name} …"`
- Implementation completion: `"✓ Codex implementation pass completed."`
- CodeRabbit operations: Various progress messages

### 3. Test Coverage Enhancements
The investigation created comprehensive test coverage:
- `test_incremental_flushing.py`: Tests print logger behavior
- `test_reproduce_stall.py`: Simulates buffering scenarios
- `test_integration_feed.py`: Integration tests for log streaming
- `run_feed_test.go`: TUI feed buffer management tests

## Validation

### Build Status
✅ `make build` - Compiles successfully
✅ `make ci` - All Go tests pass

### Expected Behavior
With these changes:
1. **Immediate progress updates**: All critical status messages appear immediately in the TUI
2. **No more apparent stalls**: Users see real-time progress even during long operations
3. **Consistent behavior**: Output timing is the same whether piped or terminal
4. **Backward compatibility**: No functional changes, only output timing improvements

## Files Modified
- `tools/auto_prd/app.py`: Added flush=True to git operations and final status
- `tools/auto_prd/review_loop.py`: Added flush=True to review waiting and feedback messages

## Files Reviewed (No Changes Needed)
- `tools/auto_prd/logging_utils.py`: Core fix already implemented
- `tools/auto_prd/local_loop.py`: Critical operations already had flush=True
- Go TUI code: Buffer management already comprehensive

## Next Steps
1. **Testing**: Run with real PRDs to verify improved live feed behavior
2. **Monitoring**: Check for any remaining stall scenarios in production
3. **Documentation**: Update troubleshooting guides with buffering information

This implementation addresses Task 5 from the investigation plan, providing concrete code adjustments to eliminate the live feed stalling issue.
